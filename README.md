# K_Means_Agglomerative_Clustering
Implemented the following clustering algorithms from scratch (1) K- Means and (2) Agglomerative Clustering

Python Script takes three arguments as input:
(1) datasetPath: corresponds to the path to the dataset file
(2) K: the k_value to use when clustering
(3) model: the model that you want to use ('km' for kmeans and 'ac' for agglomerative clustering)

This script used the yelp dataset.
